# Segment-Routing-using-DRL

## Introduction

In today's increasingly complex and interconnected world, the efficient management of network traffic is crucial for ensuring optimal performance and reliability. As networks grow in size and complexity, traditional methods of routing and traffic management often fall short, necessitating the development of more advanced and intelligent solutions. This project presents a comprehensive approach to network optimization using advanced techniques, including Network Simulation, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a tool that optimizes network traffic routing by selecting the most efficient paths through a network. This involves training models to predict the optimal number of middle points in Segment Routing (SR) and testing these predictions in various network configurations. The project leverages the power of Python libraries like NetworkX for network simulation, and PyTorch for implementing DRL models, ensuring a robust and scalable solution.

This documentation provides an in-depth exploration of the tool's functionality, the methodologies employed, and the results achieved. From loading and analyzing network topologies to training and evaluating machine learning models, the document serves as a comprehensive guide for users and developers alike. Whether you're a researcher, network engineer, or data scientist, this guide aims to equip you with the knowledge and tools needed to optimize network traffic effectively.
